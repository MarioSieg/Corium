# Nominax Runtime
Self optimizing runtime environment for programming languages like Java, Python or JavaScript.
Part of the runtime will be rewritten because there are some big changes in the system architecture.
The legacy version is still available in the legacy branch, but will be replaced with the new version as soon as possible.
